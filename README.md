# Finals COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

#### Overview
This project presents an analytical exploration of COVID-19 global data trends using Python. It integrates **pandemic statistics** such as case counts, vaccination rates, and temporal data to deliver insights into the pandemic's progression and response.

#### Features
1. **Data Loading & Processing**:
   - Utilizes datasets like `vaccination_data.csv` and `covid19_global_data.csv`.
   - Employs Pandas for data wrangling and cleaning.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes trends using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
   - Interactive charts are generated for an engaging analysis experience.

3. **Comparative Insights**:
   - Compares vaccination rollout rates and case trends across regions.
   - Highlights correlations between vaccination progress and case reduction.

4. **Tools & Libraries**:
   - Libraries used include:
     - **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
     - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Static and interactive (using %matplotlib widget) visualizations.
     - **Plotly**: Interactive dashboards.
   - Integrates modules for datetime processing to track time-based trends.

#### Objectives
- Understand global and regional COVID-19 trends.
- Investigate the impact of vaccination campaigns on case numbers.
- Provide actionable insights through clear and interactive visualizations.

#### Getting Started
- Install required libraries:
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly ipympl mplcursors  
- Run the notebook to explore the visualizations and insights.

This project is an excellent starting point for leveraging Python for public health data analysis and visualization.
